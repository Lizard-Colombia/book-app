# Book/Movie Listing Application
## Purpose
 This is an application designed to help the user keep track of their favorite
 fantasy books/movies such as Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, Artemis Fowl, etc. It is designed
 to help the the user remember how much they liked a book/movie, where in the series the book
 falls, how many pages it has, and the reading difficulty.
 ## Status
 ### Right now this app has the ability to:
 * List all of the book/movie in Alphabetical Order
 * Edit any single book/movie
 * Add a single book/movie
 * Delete a single book/movie
 ### In the future it would be nice to be able to:
 * Filter the book/movie list
 * Delete multiple books/movies at once
 * Add multiple books/movies at once
 * Edit multiple books/movies at once
 * Create categories and diplay them
